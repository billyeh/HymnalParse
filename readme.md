Hymnal Parser
============
The code in this project is aimed at parsing hymns from [http://hymnal.net](http://hymnal.net), as part of a larger project in which I plan to make an Android app that serves hymns to a client phone using my own server as a backend.

The Hymnal Parser downloads these songs automatically, and outputs them into a JSON format in text files in the hymns folder of the current working directory.

The website structure for which this code was originally aimed has changed, and though the code no longer works, modifying it wouldn't be too hard. It was still a lot of fun to make this parser.
